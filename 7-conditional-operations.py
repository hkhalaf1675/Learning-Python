# we use (if, elif, else) to make condition
# to check equality between two variables (if var1 == var2)
# to check not equality (if var1 != var2)
# to compare between two variables (if var1 > var2, if var1 < var2, var1 >= var2, â€¦)
# to opposite condition (if not var1 > var2)
# to aggregate between two or more condition (if var1 > var2 [and, or] var2 == var3)
# use or: if one condition is true , then all the if statement will be true
# use and: must be all condition be true, to execute the if statement
# we can use also match statement to match condition
# it is useful if there is a lot of condition: it is better than if statement it this situation
# we can combine more than one condition at one case
# we can make default statement if there is any condition happen
# we can combine between it and if statement
